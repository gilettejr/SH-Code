# SH-Code
Source Code for Senior Honours Project. Main file for plotting is main_plotter, which runs the plotting_class module.
Gaia_class used to plot figures from Gaia. hr_diagram and isochrones are scripts which were written then copied into plotting_class. Density_plot didn't end up being used in the final report or poster.
